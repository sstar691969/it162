Also my goals is to grow and become a full stack developer that specialize in Python, database and Postgres plus understanding how to code or script using Visual Studio Code with Git and Github. Additionally, learning Google Cloud and Linux has help me to be more innovated and advanced in learning and understanding web development to hopefully one day be a great developer.</p>
